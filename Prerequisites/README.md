# Prerequisite

There are certain prerequisite learnings that will help accelarate my understanding of the concepts that I should take time to at least familiarize myself with. 

These directories include the notes and examples for each subject. 

## Scientific Python tutorials

I don't really have a good background in these so I'll be going through the tutorials included by the author [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/index.ipynb#scrollTo=ORbC4s_ClnK7)

- [ ] [NumPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/tools_numpy.ipynb)
- [ ] [Matplotlib](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/tools_matplotlib.ipynb)
- [ ] [Pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/tools_pandas.ipynb)

## Math Tutorials

I'm not sure I'll dive into these too deeply. I took linear algebra, applied differential equations, vector calculus I & II, etc.. I know these concepts, while I might not be able to do any of the problems by memory anymore that's what computers are for. 

That said it never hurts to review and I am definitely rusty.
